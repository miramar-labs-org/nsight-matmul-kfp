## What Is Implemented

### Infrastructure (inherited from platform template)
- KFP v2 pipeline with GPU component using NGC PyTorch base image
- nsys profiling: `--profile` flag on `deploy_pipeline.py`; privileged Argo patch; PVC mount
- `purge_kfp.py`, `purge_nsight.py`
- `deploy_pipeline.py` with `--run-name`, `--profile`, `--profile-stage`

### Project-specific
- `pipeline.py` — `gpu_stage` WORKLOAD to be replaced with actual workload
- `notebook.ipynb` — development notebook stub

---

## What Is Still Pending

- Replace `WORKLOAD` in `pipeline.py` with actual GPU body
- First pipeline run
- GPU profiling run

---

## Known Issues

None yet.
